# Stretchy Surgeons
_A game of pliable physicians_

Originally conceived for [Global Game Jam 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/), Stretchy Surgeons is being revived for [PIGSquad's "Finish Your Game" Jam](https://itch.io/jam/finishyourgamejam2020).

Stretchy Surgeons is a local 2-player coop game about doctors performing surgery on each other, trying to rack up as many successful procedures as possible before time runs out or one of them runs out of humors.

Each player controls the stretchy arms of one surgeon, attempting to operate as safely as possible on the other. Players will have 1 main task ("remove spleen", "transplant heart"), as well as a list of secondary tasks to clean up any mistakes made in the main process ("stich wound", "put lung back in"). Completing these tasks will add time to a shared timer, giving the players time to complete more tasks.

Tasks will be completed by grabbing items (scalpels, replacement organs, etc) from a shared tray of tools and bonking those tools into the other player's body. Currently aspiring for the controls to be arrows/wasd only, though it's possible adding a "use" button will prove worthwhile.
